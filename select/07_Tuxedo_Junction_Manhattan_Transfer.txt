Boop bop, Boop Bop
Boop bop, Boop Bop
Boop bop, Boop Bop
Boop bop, Boop Bop

Way down South, in Birmingham
I mean South, in Alabam'
There's an old place
Where people go to dance the night away

It's a junction
Where the town folk meet
At each function in their best they'll greet you

Boop bop, Boop Bop
Boop bop, Boop Bop
Boop bop, Boop Bop
Boop bop, Boop Bop

Way down South, in Birmingham
I mean South, in Alabam'
That old place

Boop bop, Boop Bop
Boop bop, Boop Bop
Boop bop, Boop Bop
Boop bop, Boop Bop

Way down South, in Birmingham
I mean South, in Alabam'
'S an old place
Where people go to dance the night away
They all drive or walk for miles
To get blues
That southern style
So blue
It'll make you want to dance the night away
Tuxedo Junction - where I want to be
